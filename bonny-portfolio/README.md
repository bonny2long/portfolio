# 🪐 Bonny Makaniankhondo – Developer Portfolio

## Overview

This is my personal developer portfolio — designed, built, and deployed to showcase my full-stack projects, technical skillset, and growth journey as a software engineer.

Built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**, it features smooth Framer Motion animations, responsive layouts, and clean component architecture for maintainability and scalability.
